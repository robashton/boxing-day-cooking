Bisque
=====


Two left over lobster bits
A pile of king crab leftovers
A heap of king prawn leftovers
Half a bottle of white wine
A heap of butter

A few bags of vegetables which your stepmum has put in the freezer for stocks and such (yay)

Take all the fishbits and fry them in a heart attack inducing heap of butter, may need several batches because there are so many. It should go brown and sticky.

Throw in some of the vegetables and pour over some wine and cook it for a bit before throwing in a couple of litres of boiling water.

Patience padawan.
